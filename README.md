To meet the key requirements for setting up Bland.ai for making calls and scheduling presentation appointments, here's a Python-based outline for configuring and deploying an AI-powered system. Since Bland.ai is a proprietary AI platform, this code will focus on how to integrate it for automated tasks such as making calls and scheduling appointments, assuming that Bland.ai provides an API or SDK that can be used.

I'll demonstrate a simplified setup for automating a few tasks using an assumed Bland.ai API (which you'll need to adjust according to the actual documentation of Bland.ai):
Python Code Example for Setting up Bland.ai

import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Configuration for Bland.ai API (assuming it has RESTful API endpoints)
Bland_ai_api_url = "https://api.bland.ai"  # Base URL of Bland.ai API
Bland_ai_api_key = "your_bland_ai_api_key"  # API key for authentication

# Function to authenticate Bland.ai (if required)
def authenticate_bland_ai(api_key):
    # Assuming the API requires an authentication endpoint
    auth_url = f"{Bland_ai_api_url}/authenticate"
    response = requests.post(auth_url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Bland.ai authenticated successfully.")
        return response.json()['access_token']
    else:
        print(f"Authentication failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

# Function to configure Bland.ai for making calls
def configure_bland_ai_for_calls(access_token):
    # Endpoint for setting up calling functionality
    call_config_url = f"{Bland_ai_api_url}/setup_calls"
    
    # Example configuration parameters (you'll need to check Bland.ai's docs for specifics)
    payload = {
        "call_purpose": "schedule_presentation",  # Purpose of the call
        "call_script": "Please select a time for your presentation.",  # Example call script
        "retry_attempts": 3,  # Number of retries if call fails
        "contact_method": "phone"  # Mode of communication
    }

    response = requests.post(call_config_url, json=payload, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Call setup completed successfully.")
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Call setup failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

# Function to schedule appointments through Bland.ai
def schedule_appointment(contact_info, access_token):
    # Endpoint for scheduling appointments
    schedule_url = f"{Bland_ai_api_url}/schedule_appointment"
    
    # Create appointment details (adjust as necessary for your use case)
    appointment_time = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Next day's appointment
    
    payload = {
        "contact_info": contact_info,  # Customer contact details (e.g., phone number, email)
        "appointment_time": appointment_time,
        "agenda": "Presentation Appointment"  # Description of the appointment
    }
    
    response = requests.post(schedule_url, json=payload, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Appointment scheduled successfully for {contact_info['name']} at {appointment_time}.")
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Appointment scheduling failed: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
        return None

# Main setup function for configuring Bland.ai
def setup_bland_ai_system():
    # Authenticate Bland.ai
    access_token = authenticate_bland_ai(Bland_ai_api_key)
    
    if not access_token:
        return

    # Configure Bland.ai for making calls
    call_setup = configure_bland_ai_for_calls(access_token)
    
    if not call_setup:
        return

    # Example contact details (replace with actual contact info)
    contact_info = {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "phone_number": "+1234567890",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    }

    # Schedule an appointment
    schedule_appointment(contact_info, access_token)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the Bland.ai setup process
    setup_bland_ai_system()

Explanation of the Python Code:

    Authentication (authenticate_bland_ai):
        The function authenticates the Bland.ai API using an API key. This step is required if Bland.ai uses token-based authentication.
        It makes an API call to authenticate and retrieve an access token.

    Configure Calls (configure_bland_ai_for_calls):
        This function sets up Bland.ai to make calls. It sends a request with configuration parameters like call purpose (e.g., scheduling a presentation), script, retries, and contact method.
        You can modify the script and other parameters according to your needs.

    Schedule Appointments (schedule_appointment):
        The function schedules an appointment by sending the customerâ€™s contact information (phone number or email) and the scheduled time.
        The time is set to the next day for simplicity; you can modify the logic to handle more complex scheduling.

    Main Setup (setup_bland_ai_system):
        This function integrates the authentication, call setup, and appointment scheduling into one flow. It manages the interaction with Bland.ai's API, ensuring that the system is configured and operational for your business.

Required Modifications for Your Use Case:

    Replace the Bland_ai_api_url and Bland_ai_api_key with actual API details provided by Bland.ai.
    Adjust the payload and parameters according to Bland.ai's specific API documentation.
    Ensure that you have proper error handling and retries in place for real-world use.

How to Apply:

In the context of applying for a project like this, you could provide the following:

    Overview of experience: Mention any past work related to setting up AI platforms (such as Bland.ai, Twilio, Dialogflow, etc.), specifically with experience in configuring automated systems for calls, scheduling, or CRM integration.
    Availability: Confirm your immediate availability to get started, mentioning any time constraints for completing the setup (e.g., within a few days or one week).

This code is designed to be a fast, practical solution for setting up Bland.ai to make calls and schedule appointments, ensuring that the system is up and running promptly.
